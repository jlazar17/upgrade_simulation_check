# Scripts

This is where the scripts that you will have to run can be found.
Each script is in a directory and the index at the front of the directory reflects the order in which the scripts should be run.
Since we are comparing across branches, each directory will point to the branch and commit number that those particular scripts need to use.
Furthermore, the READMEs will contain example usage of the scripts.

There may be additional convenience bash scripts in a directory.
At present, I do not describe their function, but they are relatively simple.

Happy comparing.
